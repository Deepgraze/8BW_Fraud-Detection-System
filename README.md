# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

This repository contains a Credit Card Fraud Detection System implemented using the creditcard.csv dataset. 

## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and cardholders alike. With the increasing use of credit cards for online transactions, detecting fraudulent activities has become paramount. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions based on historical credit card transaction data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `creditcard.csv`, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with only 0.172% fraudulent transactions. It consists of 31 features, including time, amount, and anonymized numerical input variables V1-V28, obtained using PCA transformation due to confidentiality reasons. The 'Class' column denotes the transaction class, where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a legitimate one.

## Implementation

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The following steps summarize the implementation:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset `creditcard.csv` using pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, class balance, and correlations between features.
3. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by scaling numerical features and handling class imbalance.
4. Model Building: Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier on the preprocessed data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing model using techniques like GridSearchCV.
7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time fraud detection.

## Results

The results of the model evaluation and performance metrics are summarized in the notebook. The best-performing model along with its hyperparameters is reported, providing insights into the effectiveness of the fraud detection system.
